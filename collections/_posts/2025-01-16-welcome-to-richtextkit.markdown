RichTextKit is an SDK that aims to make it easier to add Rich Text-based features in Swift & SwiftUI.

RichTextKit makes the UIKit `UITextView` and the AppKit `NSTextView` behave more alike, and adds a lot of additional capabilities to both components.

RichTextKit also adds a SwiftUI `RichTextEditor` and a read-only `RichTextView`, which make it easy to show and edit rich text in SwiftUI-based apps.

RichTextKit is currently using the old `@ObservableObject` attribute, which isn't great for performance reasons. This is why a complete rewrite is being planned.

This upcoming rewrite will change many things, which is why RichTextKit 2 won't be compatible with RichTextKit 1, although many of the public APIs will be.

Make sure to check out the [GitHub repository]({{site.urls.github}}) to follow this work, and reach out if you want to be a part of it. There's no timeline for this project, so it may take time to both get started and finish it.
